## Title CrisisFACTS: Real-Time Multi-Stream Data Summarization for Enhanced Crisis Response and Situational Awareness
## Team Name : Rescue Retrieval
## Team Members: Raj Kariya(202103048), Asish Joel(202103015) , Aadesh Minz(202103002)

## Problem Staement
The project aims to develop a system which enchances situational awareness during crisis by summarizing crucial real-time information from various data streams such as Twitter, Reddit, and Web News. The system will generate concise daily summaries of the most relevant facts, enabling local crisis response teams to access timely and relevant information, thereby improving disaster response coordination and decision-making.

## Evaluation Strategy
The project uses the Rouge Score and BERT-Score to evaluate the system's performance in generating summaries.
